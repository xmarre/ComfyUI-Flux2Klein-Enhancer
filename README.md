Conditioning enhancement and reference latent control for FLUX.2 Klein 9B in ComfyUI. Built from empirical analysis and forward-pass tracing of the model's dual-stream architecture.

## What This Does (( NEW DISCOVERY!! ))

FLUX.2 Klein uses a Qwen3 8B text encoder that outputs conditioning tensors of shape `[batch, 512, 12288]`. Through diagnostic analysis and model hook tracing, I verified:

- **Text Conditioning**: `[1, 512, 12288]` tensor with ~67 active tokens (auto-detected from attention mask)
- **Reference Latent**: Stored separately in metadata as `[1, 128, H, W]` - NOT merged into text conditioning
- **Dual-Stream Architecture**: Text and image streams are processed separately through double_blocks, then concatenated for single_blocks

### Verified Architecture (from forward-pass hooks)

```

**Without reference latent**: img_in receives `[1, 4070, 128]`, single_blocks process `[1, 4582, 4096]`

This means:
- **Text enhancement** modifies the txt_stream input
- **Reference control** modifies half of the img_stream input (the reference portion)
- These are **independent controls** that can be combined

## Preserve Original - Solving FLUX Klein's Preservation Problem

FLUX Klein has a consistency problem. Sometimes it nails the preservation of subjects and objects. Sometimes it completely ignores what you're trying to keep and generates something else entirely. There was no native way to control this.

This node exposes preservation control that FLUX Klein doesn't provide. You can now control exactly how much original structure is maintained versus how much the prompt can modify the generation.

### The Modes

#### dampen (Recommended)
Reduces modification strength before applying changes. This is the most reliable mode for precise preservation.

**For consistent identity/object preservation: 1.20 to 1.30**

#### linear
Applies full modifications, then blends the result back with the original.

#### hybrid
Dampens parameters first, then blends the result.

#### blend_after
Same as linear, just a different name.

### Usage

- **1.20-1.30 (dampen)**: Recommended starting point for solid preservation
- **1.40-1.50**: Tighter control when needed, very prompt-dependent
- **0.0-1.0**: Standard range from full enhancement to balanced preservation

## How It Works

### Text Conditioning Enhancement

#### Magnitude
Direct scaling of all embedding vectors in the active region:
```python
active = active * magnitude
```

#### Contrast (Safe Implementation)
Computes the mean embedding across the sequence, then amplifies deviations:
```python
seq_mean = active.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)
deviation = active - seq_mean
if contrast >= 0:
    scale = 1.0 + contrast
else:
    scale = math.exp(contrast)  # Never inverts, asymptotes to 0
active = seq_mean + deviation * scale
```

Note: Negative contrast uses exponential scaling to prevent semantic inversion that occurs with linear scaling below -1.

#### Normalize Strength
Equalizes token magnitudes toward a uniform value:
```python
token_norms = active.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
mean_norm = token_norms.mean()
normalized = active / token_norms * mean_norm
active = active * (1.0 - normalize_strength) + normalized * normalize_strength
```

### Reference Latent Control

Strength is applied to `k` and `v` inside every attention block via `attn1_patch`, after all normalisation has completed:

```python
# Token layout: [ txt_tokens | main_img_tokens | ref_0_tokens | ... | ref_N_tokens ]
k[:, :, seq_start:seq_end, :] *= strength
v[:, :, seq_start:seq_end, :] *= strength
```

`reference_image_num_tokens` from `extra_options` gives the exact token count per reference, allowing precise per-reference indexing without affecting other tokens.

### Active Region Detection
Auto-detected from attention mask:
```python
attn_mask = meta.get("attention_mask", None)
nonzero = attn_mask[0].nonzero()
active_end = int(nonzero[-1].item()) + 1
```

## BETA: Mask-Guided Reference Latent Controller

> Experimental — results are promising but behavior may vary depending on prompt and image complexity.

### FLUX.2 Klein Mask Ref Controller

Spatially controls the reference latent using a mask. Masked area gets targeted by the prompt while staying true to its original structure. Unmasked area gets fully freed up for the prompt to take over.

Not inpainting — works entirely at the conditioning level through the reference latent stream.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `mask` | — | MASK | Defines targeted vs free regions. Connect from any ComfyUI mask node. |
| `strength` | 1.0 | 0.0 to 1.0 | How free the unmasked area is. 1.0 = reference fully removed there. 0.5 = half reference kept. Lower values also bleed influence into surrounding areas. |
| `invert_mask` | False | True/False | Flip targeted and free regions. |
| `feather` | 0 | 0 to 64 | Gaussian blur on mask edges in latent space. Reduces hard seams at boundaries. |
| `channel_mode` | all | all/low/high | Which latent channels the mask affects. `low` = structure/layout (ch 0-63), `high` = texture/detail (ch 64-127). |
| `debug` | False | True/False | Print spatial stats and attenuation to console. |

#### Notes
- Requires image edit mode — reference latents must be present in conditioning metadata
- `strength` also controls boundary bleed — 1.0 is a tight boundary, lower values spread influence into neighboring regions
- Useful for targeting a specific subject within a scene while leaving the rest open to the prompt

## Identity Preservation Nodes

Two nodes that approach identity preservation from outside the model's conditioning pipeline. They bypass text streams, attention masks, and token injection entirely.

### FLUX.2 Klein Identity Guidance

Operates in the sampling loop. After the model predicts the denoised image at each step, compares it to the reference latent and pulls it back. The model runs freely, then gets corrected.

Takes a VAE-encoded reference image directly. ReferenceLatent should still be connected on the conditioning path so the model has reference context.

**Wiring:**
```
[Checkpoint] → MODEL → [Identity Guidance] → MODEL → [KSampler]
                              ↑
                    [VAE Encode of reference]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `strength` | 0.3 | 0.0 to 1.0 | How hard to pull toward the reference each step. 0.3 = move 30% of the distance. |
| `start_percent` | 0.0 | 0.0 to 1.0 | When to start correcting. 0.0 = beginning of denoising. |
| `end_percent` | 0.8 | 0.0 to 1.0 | When to stop correcting. 0.8 = last 20% runs freely for texture refinement. |
| `mode` | adaptive | adaptive/direct/channel_match | How correction is applied (see below). |

#### Modes

- **adaptive**: Pulls only where the prediction already resembles the reference. Preserves prompt-driven changes like new backgrounds or poses.
- **direct**: Pulls everywhere equally. Strongest identity lock, least prompt freedom.
- **channel_match**: Forces the generation's color and feature statistics to match the reference without copying spatial content.

---

### FLUX.2 Klein Identity Feature Transfer

Operates inside the model's attention layers. After each attention block computes, finds where the generation's features are similar to the reference's features and pushes them closer.

**Requires** ReferenceLatent connected. The reference must already be in the image stream.

**Wiring:**
```
[Checkpoint] → MODEL → [Identity Feature Transfer] → MODEL → [KSampler]
                                                        ↑
                        [ReferenceLatent] → CONDITIONING → [KSampler]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `strength` | 0.15 | 0.0 to 1.0 | Per-block blend factor. Fires at every active block (cumulative). Start at 0.10 to 0.20. |
| `start_block` | 0 | 0 to 23 | First block index to apply. Index is shared across double and single blocks (resets when single blocks begin). |
| `end_block` | 23 | 0 to 23 | Last block index to apply. Covers 8 double blocks (0-7) then 24 single blocks (index resets 0-23). |
| `mode` | cosine_pull | cosine_pull/topk_replace/mean_transfer | How features are transferred (see below). |
| `top_k_percent` | 0.25 | 0.01 to 1.0 | topk_replace mode only. Fraction of tokens to affect. |

#### Modes

- **cosine_pull**: Each generation token finds its most similar reference token and gets pulled toward it. Strength scales with similarity.
- **topk_replace**: Only the top K% most similar tokens are affected. Everything else stays untouched.
- **mean_transfer**: Shifts the overall feature distribution toward the reference without spatial matching.

---

### Combining Both Nodes

Both nodes can be stacked. Identity Guidance handles macro-level correction in latent space. Feature Transfer handles micro-level feature alignment inside attention. They operate at different stages and don't interfere.

```
[Checkpoint] → MODEL → [Identity Feature Transfer] → MODEL → [Identity Guidance] → MODEL → [KSampler]
```
